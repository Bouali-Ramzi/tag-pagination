# Paginate categories with Eleventy

This is a test with Eleventy to:

1. create a blogposts collection that uses a custom taxonomy (`categories`)
2. create a collection of all unique categories used throughout the blogposts collection
3. paginate blogposts in each category using [Zach's method](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/332#issuecomment-445236776)
